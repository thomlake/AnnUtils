AnnUtils
=======

AnnUtils provides a set of general utility functions for thing I commonly need to do when working with anns.

Functionality
-------------
* Visualization (weights and states)
* Generating Random Binary Patterns
* Generate Binary Reconstruction Datasets
* Generate Random Binary Representations of data

Installation
============
installing (you may need sudo)::

    $ python setup.py install

Documentation
=============
There is none, but if there was, this is how it would work.
You'll need `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_ to build documentation.
Sphinx is available from PyPI or if you have easy install::
	
    $ easy_intall -U Sphinx

Once you've obtained Sphinx build html documentation::

	$ cd /path/to/AnnUtils/doc/
	$ make html

pdf documentation is not currently working.
